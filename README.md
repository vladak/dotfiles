# vladak's dotfiles

This is a no-nonsense (I hope) collection of dotfiles and helper scripts
with simple script to sync them.

The dotfiles are populated from `config` via symbolic links. Files from `bin`
are copied to `~/bin`.

This exists primarily for the configuration of:
  - `bash`
  - `vim`
  - `git`

Most of the configuration can be adjusted using local files (e.g. `~/.vimrc_local` or `~/.bashrc_local`).
